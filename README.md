Code and data needed to reproduce the results in manuscript "Unraveling the mechanism behind the potential extinction of the B/Yamagata lineage of influenza B viruses"  

./code includes:  
--PREDAC folder includes two subfolders BV and BY. BV includes python scripts to construct the antigenic prediction models for B/Victoria while BY includes python scripts to construct the antigenic prediction models for B/Yamagata.  

--dynamic_model folder includes two subfolders parameters_estimation, simulation, and sensitivity_analysis to construct the two-lineage transmission model for B/Victoria and B/Yamagata:  
./parameters_estimation was used to estimiate the parameters by MCMC.  
./simulation was used to do scenario analyses.  
./sensitivity_analysis was do sensitivity analysis about key parameters. 

--figure folder includes scripts to plot the figure of the paper.
All scripts with the command suffix were used to run the corresponding above scripts.

./data includes the related dataset used in the corresponding scripts in ./code folder or the results.
